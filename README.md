### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Beatriz
##### I'm an IOS Developer and I love animals plants and textile arts

I am a developer since 2016. I`ve worked with chatbots, data mining, Typescript, Javascript, TDD, Flutter, Swift, and much more.
Technology is my inspiration, it changed my life and I hope it changes the life of much more people.
