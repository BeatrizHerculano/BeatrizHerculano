| Swift        | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ  | Used in a daily basis with complex scenarios. Applied many different concepts and techniques like TDD, functional programming, Design Patterns, Clean Architecture and more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| View Code    | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ | Built many screens with complex designs and components for design systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Animation    | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ | Applied animations wherever I had an opportunity stating with simple animations as a progress bar to more complex ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Unit Testing | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ| Unit testing has had a significant impact on my coding practices. Ever since I started working with Backend in JS, I have implemented unit testing in my projects and achieved up to 90% code coverage. Even during my iOS development experience, I was able to create a module for a super app with 80% of the code tested.                                                                                                                                   |
| XCodegen     | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ| Since the start of my career in IOS development, I have used Xcodegen. It is an excellent tool for simplifying text and managing multiple languages, preventing errors in collaborative app development, and customizing the Xcode project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CocoaPods    | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ | CocoaPods was the main dependency manager in the projects I worked on. I am experienced in using to install new dependencies and managing the pod spec file for the modules I developed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Git          | ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ | I've been using Git for version control in my projects since I started development. Over time, I've utilized various branch management techniques such as trunk-based and Git flow. I've gained a reputation for being skilled in resolving conflicts that arise during merges and rebases in my previous experiences. Currently, I'm looking to expand my knowledge by learning more about the cherry-pick command and understanding the underlying processes. |
